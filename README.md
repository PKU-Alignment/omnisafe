OmniSafe is an infrastructural framework designed to accelerate safe reinforcement learning (RL) research.
It provides a comprehensive and reliable benchmark for safe RL algorithms, and also an out-of-box modular toolkit for researchers.
SafeRL intends to develop algorithms that minimize the risk of unintended harm or unsafe behavior.

OmniSafe stands as the inaugural unified learning framework in the realm of safe reinforcement learning, aiming to foster the Growth of SafeRL Learning Community.
The key features of OmniSafe:

- **Highly Modular Framework.** OmniSafe presents a highly modular framework, incorporating an extensive collection of tens of algorithms tailored for safe reinforcement learning across diverse domains. This framework is versatile due to its abstraction of various algorithm types and well-designed API, using the Adapter and Wrapper design components to bridge gaps and enable seamless interactions between different components. This design allows for easy extension and customization, making it a powerful tool for developers working with different types of algorithms.

- **High-performance parallel computing acceleration.** By harnessing the capabilities of `torch.distributed`, OmniSafe accelerates the learning process of algorithms
with process parallelism. This enables OmniSafe not only to support environment-level asynchronous parallelism but also incorporates agent asynchronous learning. This methodology bolsters training stability and expedites the training process via the deployment of a parallel exploration mechanism. The integration of agent asynchronous learning in OmniSafe underscores its commitment to providing a versatile and robust platform for advancing SafeRL research.

- **Out-of-box toolkits.** OmniSafe offers customizable toolkits for tasks like training, benchmarking, analyzing, and rendering. [Tutorials](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/omnisafe#getting-started) and user-friendly [APIs](https://omnisafe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/baserlapi/on_policy.html) make it easy for beginners and average users, while advanced researchers can enhance their efficiency without complex code.

#### Customizing your environment

We offer a flexible customized environment interface that allows users to achieve the following **without modifying the OmniSafe source code**:

- Use OmniSafe to train algorithms on customized environments.
- Create the the environment with specified personalized parameters.
- Complete the recording of environment-specific information in Logger.

We provide **step-by-step tutorials** on [Environment Customization From Scratch](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PKU-Alignment/omnisafe/blob/main/tutorials/English/3.Environment%20Customization%20from%20Scratch.ipynb) and [Environment Customization From Community](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PKU-Alignment/omnisafe/blob/main/tutorials/English/4.Environment%20Customization%20from%20Community.ipynb) to give you a detailed introduction on how to use this extraordinary feature of OmniSafe.

*Note: If you find trouble customizing your environment, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/omnisafe/issues) or [discussion](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/omnisafe/discussions). [Pull requests](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/omnisafe/pulls) are also welcomed if you're willing to contribute the implementation of your environments interface.*

#### Try with CLI

```bash
pip install omnisafe

omnisafe --help  # Ask for help

omnisafe benchmark --help  # The benchmark also can be replaced with 'eval', 'train', 'train-config'

# Quick benchmarking for your research, just specify:
# 1. exp_name
# 2. num_pool(how much processes are concurrent)
# 3. path of the config file (refer to omnisafe/examples/benchmarks for format)

# Here we provide an exampe in ./tests/saved_source.
# And you can set your benchmark_config.yaml by following it
omnisafe benchmark test_benchmark 2 ./tests/saved_source/benchmark_config.yaml

# Quick evaluating and rendering your trained policy, just specify:
# 1. path of algorithm which you trained
omnisafe eval ./tests/saved_source/PPO-{SafetyPointGoal1-v0} --num-episode 1

# Quick training some algorithms to validate your thoughts
# Note: use `key1:key2`, your can select key of hyperparameters which are recursively contained, and use `--custom-cfgs`, you can add custom cfgs via CLI
omnisafe train --algo PPO --total-steps 2048 --vector-env-nums 1 --custom-cfgs algo_cfgs:steps_per_epoch --custom-cfgs 1024

# Quick training some algorithms via a saved config file, the format is as same as default format
omnisafe train-config ./tests/saved_source/train_config.yaml
```
